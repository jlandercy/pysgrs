# Changes

## To do

 - [ ] Add Braille alphabet
 - [ ] Create iterator to consume string with variable length symbols (Morse)
 - [ ] Create parametric cleanser (can be disabled) to remove accents and uniformize special chars ('Â´)

 - [ ] Iterate all smallest rectangle able to contains text
 - [ ] Assess the needs to create ReversibleCypher class
 - [ ] Need a good and well designed toolbox for iterators, number theory (gcd, modinv)
 - [ ] Column and row shuffling
 - [ ] Pandas manipulations, reshape, squeeze
 - [ ] Create a factory for frequency mapping
