# Changes

## To do

 - [ ] Add Braille alphabet
 - [x] Create parametric cleanser (can be disabled) to remove accents and uniformize special chars ('Â´)
 - [x] Iterate all smallest rectangle able to contains text
 - [ ] Assess the needs to create ReversibleCypher class
 - [x] Need a good and well-designed toolbox for iterators, number theory (gcd, modinv)
 - [ ] Column and row shuffling
 - [x] Pandas manipulations, reshape, squeeze
 - [x] Create a factory for frequency mapping
 - [ ] Make Shape cyphers standards about shape selection and create an _apply method
 - [ ] Consider the need to create a Message object (CypherMessage and ClearMessage) holding necessary properties
   (as alphabet, shape, separators, specials chars, etc.) and helping to discriminate among forms (str, block, vector and matrix)
 - [ ] Challenge your library against previous SGRS quiz with answers
 - [ ] Properly document function as soon as you fixed the interface
 - [ ] Raise error or warning if parse cannot consume completely the string
 - [ ] Add Autokey Cypher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher)
 - [ ] Add Chao Cypher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaocipher)
 - [ ] Add Hill Cypher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher)  
 - [ ] Add Code Breakers:
